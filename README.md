## 🚀 Overview
**CLINOVA** is a modern ERP solution designed to digitize hospital operations. Unlike traditional CRUD apps, it implements complex medical workflows like **OPD Queue Management**, **Inventory FIFO Logic**, and **Real-time Bed Allocation**.

Built with a focus on **Data Security (RLS)** and **Actionable Analytics**, ensuring that sensitive patient data remains protected while Admins get a bird's-eye view of operations.
